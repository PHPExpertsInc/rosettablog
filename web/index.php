/** Single Page MVC
* MVC stands for the Model View Controller Design Pattern.
* 
* This is a very popular design pattern for websites because it 
*    * allows for far less cluttered and more organized code
*    * makes it far more easier to share code between pages and to add new pages
*    * separates XHTML, CSS and JavaScript (the Views), allowing for
*      XHTML editing by persons unfamiliar with PHP (important for businesses)
*    * separates business logic (Model) from the View
*    * acts as a defacto standard for organizing a site that professionals readily comprehend.
